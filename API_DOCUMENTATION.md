# Service Provider API Documentation
## Testing the API

Download Postman desktop since local host requests only work on desktop make sure to run the project in background otherwise postman won't give any response.

## Overview
This API provides endpoints for managing service providers. It's built with Node.js, Express, and TypeORM(for now will be replaced by Prisma), using SQLite as the database(will be replace by Postgres).

Base URL: `http://localhost:3000` (Development for now)
After Hojaega.pk gets deployed it will change to 'http://hojaega.pk'

## Authentication
Currently, no authentication is required for any endpoints.

## Common Response Format
All API responses follow this structure:
```json
{
  "success": boolean,
  "data": any,
  "count": number,
  "message": string
}
```

## Error Response Format
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": string,
  "error": string
}
```

## Subscription System Overview

### How Subscriptions Work

1. **New Service Provider Creation**:
   - Automatically gets 1-month subscription
   - `status` set to 1 (active)
   - `subscriptionStartDate` = current date
   - `subscriptionEndDate` = current date + 1 month

2. **Subscription Lifecycle**:
   ```
   Active (status: 1) â†’ Expires â†’ Pending (status: 0) â†’ Renewed â†’ Active again
   ```

3. **Automatic Status Updates**:
   - Pending API automatically detects expired subscriptions
   - Updates status from 1 to 0 when subscription period ends
   - No manual intervention required

### Subscription Status Values

- **1**: Active subscription (can provide services)
- **0**: Expired subscription (needs payment renewal)

### Business Benefits

- **Automated Management**: No manual subscription tracking needed
- **Payment Collection**: Clear identification of providers needing payment
- **Service Continuity**: Providers can't operate without active subscription
- **Revenue Tracking**: Monitor subscription renewals and payments
- **Customer Experience**: Clear communication about subscription status
